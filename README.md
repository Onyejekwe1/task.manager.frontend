# Task Manager Application
This project is a simple Task Manager web application built with NuxtJS (Version 2) for the frontend and Spring Boot Webflux for the backend. 
The application allows users to view, create, and mark tasks as completed.

### Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:

* Node.js and npm (for running the frontend)

## Running the App

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

``` shell
cd your-project-frontend-directory

```

2. Install dependencies:

``` shell
npm install
```

3. Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000:

``` shell
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.



## Usage
* The backend API provides endpoints for managing tasks (creating, viewing, and updating).
* The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with these tasks.
